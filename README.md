# GOG Galaxy Achievement Manager

GOG Galaxy Achievement Manager (GGAM) is an application used to manage achievements in the gaming platform [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy). This application requires the GOG Galaxy, GOG.com account and network access. GOG Galaxy must be running and the user must be logged in.

**Important Notice:** This application is intended for advanced users. It requires access to sensitive information (clientID, clientSecret, and achievementKeys) that are typically only available to game developers through the GOG Developer Portal. Obtaining this information requires reverse engineering game files, which is a complex process. Therefore, GGAM is currently not suitable for general users.

## How to Use

1. Fill in `clientID`, `clientSecret`, and `achievementKeys` in `Program.cs`.
2. Build and run.
3. Wait up to 30 seconds until network communication complete.
4. Check Achievement page in Galaxy.

## Disclaimer

This application is provided as-is, without any warranty. The developers of GGAM are not responsible for any issues that may arise from its use, including account suspension or data loss. Use this application at your own risk.

**Reverse engineering game files may violate the terms of service of some games. Ensure you understand the potential consequences before proceeding.**
